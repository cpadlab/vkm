# CONTRIBUTING

Welcome to VKM! We are delighted that you want to contribute to our project. To ensure that all contributors have a positive experience, we have created these contribution guidelines. Please be sure to read them carefully before contributing.

## Code of Conduct:

All taxpayers must follow our code of conduct. This means that we expect all members of our community to treat each other with respect and consideration. We will not tolerate any abusive, harassing or discriminatory behaviour.

## New features:

We love getting suggestions for new features. If you have an idea to improve VKM, please create a pull request or issue on Github. Make sure your request includes a clear and concise description of the new functionality. 



## Guidelines

Open and closed public relations: Before submitting a pull request, please check that your suggestion has not already been proposed. If there's an open request for the same functionality, consider joining that request instead of creating a new one. If the application has been closed, please check the reason for the closure before resubmitting.

- Check your spelling and grammar: To ensure that your code is easy to read and maintain, it is important that good spelling and grammar are maintained in all files. Please check your spelling and grammar before submitting any pull requests.

- Use clear and concise comments: To help other contributors understand the code, it is important that you use clear and concise comments. If you're implementing new functionality, include comments explaining how it works. If you're making changes to existing code, make sure your comments reflect those changes.

- Test thoroughly: Make sure all new features and code changes are properly tested before submitting a pull request. Include unit and integration tests, and make sure your code is free of bugs and bugs.

- Keep communication open: If you have questions or concerns about existing code or the contribution process, feel free to reach out to the other contributors or core developers. Open and honest communication is essential to maintain a healthy and constantly evolving project.
  
- Respect the decisions of the core developers: While we appreciate all contributions, not all pull requests may be accepted. If a core developer decides your pull request isn't a good fit for the project, respect their decision and work with them to find a workaround.

- Be patient and understanding: The contribution process can take time, and you may not see your changes implemented immediately. Be patient and understanding with the other contributors and core developers, and work collaboratively to make VKM a better project.


If you are fluent in another language and would like to contribute by translating this list into that language, please submit a PR using the following guidelines:

Add a new folder to the translations

The new folder should be labeled with the name of the language culture, p, es-ES, ru-RU, zh-CN, etc. Based on ISO 639-1 (language code) and ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (country code) standards.

Also, feel free to review already translated content for accuracy.

## Everyone is welcome to contribute!
